**About Walmart**

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.

  
**Business Problem**

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the 
customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending 
habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male 
and 50 million are female).

**Metric**

- We will use visualization of all variable with purchase amount to visually confirm our findings.
- Central Limit Theorem with bootstrapping will be used to estimate the confidence interval.
- Hypothesis testing will be done on Gender, Marital Status and Age using z test and t test to answer question about spending patterns

  
**Dataset**

The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday. 
The dataset has the following features:  

- User\_ID:User ID  
- Product\_ID:Product ID  
- Gender:Sex of User  
- Age:Age in bins  
- Occupation:Occupation(Masked)  
- City\_Category:Category of the City (A,B,C)  
- StayInCurrentCityYears:Number of years stay in current city
